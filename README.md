# Project Eular Solutions

Solutions of problems from https://projecteuler.net/, a website dedicated to the fascinating world of mathematics and programming.

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

Years Ago, I haved worked out some of starting problems, about 100+, however, I have lost my old account and the source code in Cpp. Okay, this the new starting point, and I hope guys who run into this Github Repo could also support Project Eular, and continue solving those intresting problems.

This time, I attemp to solve each of the problems from different aspects and using different programming languages, besides translating them to Chinese. Some the programming languages I listed as follows are my favorites, and dive deep into them, even use them in real world projects. While others I had no further or deeper research on them. However, solutions for the problems would work perfectly well.

* [C/C++](./c_cpp/)
* [Common Lisp](./commonlisp/)
* [C#](./csharp/)
* [Elixir](./elixir/)
* [Go](./go/)
* [Haskell](./haskell/)
* [Lua](./lua/)
* [Java](./java/)
* [JavaScript](./javascript/)
* [Perl](./perl/)
* [PHP](./php/)
* [Python](./python/)
* [Ruby](./ruby/)
* [Rust](./rust/)
* [Scala](./scala/)
* [Scheme](./scheme/)
* [Swift](./swift/)
* [Visual Basic .NET](./vb.net/)
